# This is my fisrt and beautiful portfolio build using React
So dont worry is gonna be a very exciting adventure :P

## Work done, well not quite yet
Ass you can see the main look is done, but still a lot of work to be done the mobile version is looking awesome but the desketop need some mayor corrections, of font-size, align, and overall organization of the elements I want as part of my portfolio

## Some weird ideas in my mind
Also a crazy idea in my mind, I have always think of my self as a rebel, always in the side of the need ones and trying to help people as I can. I'm having a problem with the colors and how I describe my self, think a mayor change of colors is needed this colors I'm using are what the tutorials and "web experts" say should be use. But as a rebel I'm as an independent individual I need to express what I do and how, and the main reason I have is no matter how many advices or tutorials I follow I'm still not getting what I need or want. I need what I need and know what I want so it's time to make clear this is my portfolio and do what I want.
